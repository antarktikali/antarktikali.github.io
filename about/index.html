<h2>Who I am</h2>

<p>I&#39;m Şan Güneş from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Names_of_Istanbul#Old_Norse">Miklagard</a>.
I studied computer science in Bahçeşehir University. I&#39;ve been
interested in game development since high school when I started making mods
for games. I took this further by making my own games after I entered
university.</p>

<p>I&#39;m using GNU/Linux since 2007 and I&#39;ve been dual booting between GNU/Linux and
Windows since then. However thanks to Steam, I use Windows less frequently now.</p>

<p>During my childhood I lived in various parts of Russia with my parents who
worked there.</p>

<p>I&#39;m also interested in analog photography. You can check my <a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/antarktikali/">flickr page</a>
for some photos.</p>

<h2>About the site</h2>

<p>The domain name 350 comes from the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abjad_numerals">Abjad</a>
numerization of my name.</p>
