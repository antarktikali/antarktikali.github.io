<h1>Adventures with PSXSDK</h1>
<p class="meta">15 Feb 2015</p>
<div class="post">
<p>Since 2013, I&#39;m participating in the global game jam at a local site close to
where I live. I do it mostly for fun and to socialize, rather than making a
&quot;cool&quot; game. For this reason since two years I go home and sleep during the jam
nights and come back in the morning. Better to take it easy, eh?</p>

<p>One of the diversifiers for this year was the following:</p>

<blockquote>
<p><strong>NES</strong>: Make the game playable on an old school console, either directly or
through an emulator.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Remembering that I recently bought a PS One with 5 original games and two
controllers(which was by the way a nice deal of 15 Euros), I decided to go with
this diversifier to make a game for the PSX platform.</p>

<p>After a small search on the internet I&#39;ve found two suitable SDK&#39;s for this:</p>

<p>The first one is the Psy-Q SDK, which was the official SDK for the PS1. Today it
has bunch of documentation on the internet, however it was not updated since
ages. Furthermore, it only runs on 32-bit Windows systems and due to it&#39;s closed
nature it&#39;s not easy to use it on a GNU/Linux system.</p>

<p>The second one was the PSXSDK, which is actually a set of free and open source
tools and the necessary toolchain for building programs compatible with the
PSX hardware. Unfortunately for now it only supports 2D games, but I don&#39;t have
enough hairs on my chest to code a 3D game for the PSX anyway.</p>

<h2>Getting the PSXSDK</h2>

<p>The SDK can be downloaded from <a href="http://unhaut.fav.cc/psxsdk/">here</a>. There is a
precompiled toolchain available. It worked fine for me on Debian 7, just had to
create some symbolic links to some libraries for the older version numbers. The
SDK basically contains a GCC compiler configured for the MIPS architecture, and
some programs for converting files.</p>

<h2>Process of building a PSX game with PSXSDK</h2>

<p>Here are the summery of the process for building a game:</p>

<ul>
<li>Convert the assets using the tools provided. For example you can convert WAV
files to VAG, and BMP images to TIM. There is a very uncomfortable thing with
creating TIM files, which I will explain later.</li>
<li>Then you build the code and obtain an ELF binary.</li>
<li>Using the elf2exe converter, create an EXE file from the ELF binary.</li>
<li>Using the systemcnf tool, create a system.cnf file from the EXE.</li>
</ul>

<p>At this point you actually have the necessary files, and in theory you can run
the EXE file using an emulator. However this was not working for me with the
PCSX emulator. I could only run the BIN/CUE image on the emulator. The rest of
the steps to do this are as follows:</p>

<ul>
<li>Create an ISO image of the root folder of your game where the necessary files
are. I was using genisoimage to do this.</li>
<li>Using the mkpsxiso tool provided, convert the ISO to a PSX compatible BIN and
provide a license file. I&#39;ll write about this license file later.</li>
</ul>

<p>So you are actually done, you can either run this BIN image using an emulator or
burn it to a disc.</p>

<h2>Copy protection in the PSX</h2>

<p>Detailed info about the security system in the PS1 can be found <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150215141841/http://wololo.net/2012/12/10/how-ps1-security-works/">here</a>.
After reading the article it is possible to say that there is no importance of
the license file that we put in our BIN image. As long as you are burning your
disc with a conventional CD driver, you would either need a modded PSX or to do
the swap-trick in order to run your game. Unfortunately my PS One was not modded
so I had to do the swap-trick every time I tried to test the game on the device.</p>

<h2>Video RAM of the PSX</h2>

<p>As explained <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150215143146/https://github.com/zargener/psxsdkdoc/blob/master/psxsdk.adoc">here</a>,
the VRAM of the PSX has a drawing and a display area, together with an area for
loading the textures. Basically when you load an image file(TIM), you load it
to the area on the right(see the image in the above link).</p>

<p>When using the bmp2tim tool of the PSXSDK, you have to specify the origins for
loading the image in the framebuffer. Yes, while converting the BMP image. This
can easily turn to be very complicated. In fact, it made me question myself why
I didn&#39;t just use Unity3d to make a game.</p>

<p>For example in our game we were using 320x240 resolution for the PSX. This means
there were two rectangles of size 320x240 with the top-left origins of (0,0) and
(0,240). These two areas were used as display buffers, While the area after 320
pixels horizontally was left for loading the textures. Having a background image
of size 320x240 for each background, I tried to set their origins to (320,0).
For some reason, the right part of the background images were not rendered.
After some while I found out that the textures couldn&#39;t be bigger than 256
pixels in each dimension, so I divided the background images to two separate
images of size 160x240, loading them to framebuffer origins (320,0) and (480,0).</p>

<p>One has to be careful about the origins in the framebuffer, if you place the
textures in overlapping places in the VRAM, and later load the overlapping
images in your code, the image which you load previously would be overwritten
by the overlapping image.</p>

<p>Anyway, this was just a jam game so I&#39;m sure there are bunch of interesting
stuff about PSXSDK which I&#39;m not aware of. To sum up, it was a nice experience
to work on a 20 year old platform! kthxbye!</p>
