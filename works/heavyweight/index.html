<p>HeavyWeight was made during the Global Game Jam event in 2014 using the Unity
engine. The design was made together with a friend of mine who also did the
visuals.</p>

<p>The game came out as an experimental idea where the player is encouraged to
question the way how the games give us orders, making a connection to the real
life.</p>

<p>The game is published under the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WTFPL">WTFPL</a> and
the sources can be found in the download link above.</p>
