<p>Scientist Escape was made during the <a href="http://bug.bahcesehir.edu.tr/">BUG</a> game
development summer school at the Bahçeşehir University in 2012. This is my first
title made with the Unity engine.</p>

<p>The game was rewarded the <strong>GameX Best Indie Game</strong> title in the GameX
exposition in 2012. <a href="http://www.bahcesehir.edu.tr/haber/bug_ilk_odulunu_aldi">(source in Turkish)</a></p>

<h2>Fun facts:</h2>

<p>As I mentioned, this was my first game made with Unity and was made in a limited
time. Therefore I would like to share some funny facts about how the game works.</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Back then Unity didn&#39;t have 2D colliders, and the collider for the door in the
menu screen is actually a box collider hanging in the 3D scene, with the angle
made so that it covers the door from the camera angle.</p></li>
<li><p>There is no animation in the main menu for the falling cubes, they are 100%
physics. Initially I wanted the cubes to fall just a little to give some action,
but out of luck there was this nice point where the cube above would fall and
bounce by rotating. So I just left it like that and it looks fine.</p></li>
<li><p>In the credits scene, the credits are actually a plane with an image which has
the script for the moving lasers attached to it and moves up and down.</p></li>
<li><p>Initially the scenes didn&#39;t have any light maps and after a recommendation
from one of my mentors, I spent the last night baking lightmaps on my laptop
with Intel graphics and it was definitely worth it.</p></li>
</ul>
