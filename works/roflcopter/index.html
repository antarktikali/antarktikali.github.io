<p>I made this game out of boredom in one night using Unity3d. It&#39;s a combination
of the famous <a href="http://www.helicoptergame.net/">helicopter game</a> and the
ROFLcopter internet meme. This is the first game I&#39;ve released for Windows
Phone.</p>

<p>Together with a friend who had experience with Android, we tried to make some
SEO for the Google Play however it didn&#39;t help much. Another thing to consider
is the icons play a big role when people chose your game to download. And while
uploading the icon to Google Play, there was only one size for it and the image
would be scaled automatically for the smaller icon sizes. This caused the icon
image with thin lines to appear bad after being scaled down automatically.</p>

<p>For the Windows Phone side I haven&#39;t made any SEO in the description or the
name and haven&#39;t made any advertisement of the game. In 12th of July the
download count suddenly increased from 4 to 11, and after one bad review on 13th
of July, the daily download count decreased significantly. This shows the
effect of the reviews on your app.</p>
